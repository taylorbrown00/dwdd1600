        <h1>Shop: Types of Flowers</h1>
        <p>"Flowers constantly bring us joy and make our lives happier, they decorate our home and gardens. Flowers from
            ancient times always captivated us with their smell, colors, shape and more. There are so many varieties of
            flowers that we can learn about and explore and sometimes its hard to imagine, how many types of flowers are
            actually are there in the world, and what are the most popular flowers in the world?" A quote from our
            favorite flower website.<a href="https://wowbouquet.com/blog/types-of-flowers/" target="_blank"> Click here

            <dd>We make corsages and boutonnieres for events like high school dances or even weddings.</dd>
            <dt>Weddings</dt>
            <dd>Weddings involve lots of different flower arrangements but the first most important is the boquete for
                the bride. Like we also stated sometime corsages and boutonnieres are used as well. We also have done
                flower crowns or necklaces.</dd>

        <dl>
            <dt>Backdrop</dt>
            <dd>A big hit is always our flower backdrop, ranging anywhere from arches to fully flower filled panels. It
                is always great for the photo opportunities at events. </dd>
            <dt>Staircase</dt>
            <dd>At most locations there is a staircase, and it is always begging to be decorated on the handrails!</dd>
            <dt>Tables</dt>
            <dd>The tables also deserve to look good. We can do small vase arrangements, or even full table length
